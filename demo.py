# ? HTML colors and HEX codes
from kroma import html_color, HTMLColors

# example for black text with a spring green background
print(html_color.style(
    "\nThis is black text on a spring green background.",
    background=HTMLColors.SPRINGGREEN,
    foreground=HTMLColors.BLACK
))

# you can leave out either the background or foreground argument to only set one of them:
print(html_color.style(
    "This is normal text with a maroon background.",
    background=HTMLColors.MAROON
))
print(html_color.style(
    "This is goldenrod text on a normal background.",
    foreground=HTMLColors.GOLDENROD
))

# the html_color.style function also accepts HEX color codes, for example:
print(html_color.style(
    "This is text with a custom background and foreground.\n",
    background="#000094",
    foreground="#8CFF7F"
))


# ? ANSI colors
# you may want to use these if you want color support on terminals that do not support True Color.

from kroma import ansi_color, ANSIColors

# example for bright blue text with a red background
print(ansi_color.style(
    "This is bright blue text on a red background. (not too readable! lol)\n",
    background=ANSIColors.RED,
    foreground=ANSIColors.BRIGHT_BLUE
))

#* this function works the same way as html_color.style, except it uses ANSI colors instead of HTML colors.
#* so, that means you can also leave out either the background or foreground argument to only set one of them.


# ? Color manipulation
# Note: the following example works for ansi_color as well, if you use the proper color enum.
print(html_color.style(
    "This is text with the foreground and background inverted.",
    foreground=HTMLColors.BLUEVIOLET,
    background=HTMLColors.BISQUE,
    swap_foreground_background=True
))
print(html_color.style(
    "This is text with the foreground and background colors manipulated at runtime.\n",
    foreground=html_color.lighten(HTMLColors.GAINSBORO, 10),
    background=html_color.darken("#2F4F4F", 20)
))


# ? Text formatting
# Additionally, you can also apply bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough text formatting to your text.
# This works for both html_color.style and ansi_color.style functions.

# Examples:
print(html_color.style(
    "This is bold, italic, underlined, and strikethrough text.",
    bold=True,
    italic=True,
    underline=True,
    strikethrough=True
))
print(ansi_color.style("This is bold text.", bold=True))
print(html_color.style("This is underlined text.", underline=True))
print(html_color.style("This is italic and strikethrough text.", italic=True, strikethrough=True))
# As you can see, you can combine multiple formatting options in a single call.

# You can also combine text formatting with colors:
print(ansi_color.style(
    "This is bold and italic text with colors.\n",
    foreground=ANSIColors.MAGENTA,
    bold=True,
    italic=True
))
